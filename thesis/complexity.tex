\chapter{Algorithmic Complexity}
\label{chapter:complexity}

The book embedding problem  without fixed page assignments  \probBookNormal is \NP-complete. For two pages
Bernhart~\cite{Bernhart79} showed that the problem is the same
as determining whether the graph is \emph{sub-hamiltonian}, \ie a subgraph of a planar
graph with a Hamiltonian cycle. This implies that \probBookNormal is \NP-complete by a result of Widgerson's~\cite{Widgerson82},
which states that the Hamiltonian circuit problem for maximal planar graphs is \NP-complete.

Since the two page case with fixed partitions is solvable in linear time~\cite{two-page-09},
we see that fixing the partitions significantly changes the book embedding problem. Is \probBook even
\NP-complete? We answer this question in the affirmative in the first
half of this chapter (\myref{section:np-complete}),
but, unfortunately, only for an unbounded number of pages. 

Thus, we know that \probBook is probably not efficiently solvable. In spite of that, we
want to test some specific instances in \myref{section:matchings}.
For this reason, in the second half of
this chapter~(\myref{section:sat}) we show how \probBook can be solved in super-polynomial time  by reducing it to \probThreeSat with some optimisations.
We chose the \probThreeSat problem since there are solvers for it that work well
on instances occurring in practice, even though \probThreeSat is \NP-complete.
