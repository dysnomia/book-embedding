  abstract = {In taxonomy and other branches of classification it is useful to know
	when tree-like classifications on overlapping sets of labels can
	be consistently combined into a parent tree. This paper considers
	the computation complexity of this problem. Recognizing when a consistent
	parent tree exists is shown to be intractable (NP-complete) for sets
	of unrooted trees, even when each tree in the set classifies just
	four labels. Consequently determining the compatibility of qualitative
	characters and partial binary characters is, in general, also NP-complete.
	However for sets of rooted trees an algorithm is described which
	constructs the â€œstrict consensus treeâ€� of all consistent parent
	trees (when they exist) in polynomial time. The related question
	of recognizing when a set of subtrees uniquely defines a parent tree
	is also considered, and a simple necessary and sufficient condition
	is described for rooted trees.},
